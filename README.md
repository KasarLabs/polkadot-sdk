# Polkadot SDK

This repository is a fork of the Polkadot SDK by Parity tech: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk

The following branches have been made by massalabs:
- [release-polkadot-v1.3.0-std](https://github.com/massalabs/polkadot-sdk/tree/release-polkadot-v1.3.0-std), used to suit the needs of the [Madara project](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/madara)
- [release-polkadot-v1.3.0-std-only](https://github.com/massalabs/polkadot-sdk/tree/release-polkadot-v1.3.0-std-only), used only to remove the wasm executor of substrate to render it std compatible.
